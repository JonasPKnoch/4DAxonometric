Normal, three-dimensional axonometric projection is a method of mapping a three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional space. 3D axonometric projection is useful because the rules are simple, it is relatively trivial to implement, and all importantly it is easy to comprehend once it is implemented. Although there are distortions when going from a true 3D scene to an axonometric one, (there is no foreshortening for example) a human brain can look at an axonometric projection and easily understand what is going on spatially.

Axonometric projection works by forcing the axes of the projection to share with the axis of the true space. For example, in the image above the true axes of the space: x, y and z, are squeezed into the two axis of the projection (x and y). To do this, rather than being perpendicular as true axes are, axonometric axes are given by an angle. In this case, an object moving on the z axis would move up and down on the blue and purple vector, moving on the y would go forward and back on the green and cyan, and moving on the x would be forward and back along the red-yellow vector. Any movement along more than one true axis then, would project as moving along each vector added together.

Because any projected position is represented as moving along straight vectors, it is easy to visualize geometry by drawing 2D lines in between calculated points. For example, the wire-frame cube above was created by drawing straight 2D lines between the eight projected points of the true 3D cube. Additionally, geometry can be easily created by manually entering points. For example, a 3D unit-cube could be made by creating lines between (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1 ,1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0) and (1, 1, 1) projected in axonometric fashion.
The reason I explain the details and consequences of axonometric projection in such detail here, is that it is important to understand how axonometric projection works in three-dimensions before understanding how it works in four. It can also help to understand why axonometric projection was chosen by me, as a method of projecting four-dimensional space. Going back to my explanation of squeezing three axes into two, I visualize this by showing three lines crossing each other. There is nothing in the rules of axonometric projection that disallows using more than three true dimensions, and this visual explanations expands easily.

Above is the same visualization of axes as seen earlier. The difference of course, is that there are four lines here, representing the four true dimensions being squeezed onto a two dimensional space. In this case, the z axis is the cyan and blue one, the y is light and dark green, the x is red and orange and the forth, w axis is dark and light purple. And because four-dimensional axonometric projection is based on the same principles as three-dimensional projection, all the rules of the latter apply to the former. For example, a 4-dimensional, axonometric hyper-cube looks like this:

Though this may look like an abstract flower at first, it is possible to make out the eight individual cubes that make up this hyper-cube upon closer inspection. Like the 3D cube, this one was simply made by manual entering 4D coordinates, in this case (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1, 0) and finally (1, 1, 1, 1) for the 4D  unit-hyper-cube.
This method of projection is useful for the same reasons that 3-dimensional projections is useful: the rules behind it are simple, the implementation is only slightly more complicated than in 3D, and most importantly still, it is relatively easy to comprehend. The last point is questionable, as the the image above is hardly an easily understood geometric space; however, compared to other methods of 4D visualization, the simplicity of the axonometric method is straightforward. The lack of foreshortening for example, removes spatial distortion, and consistency of angles means that an object's four-dimensional position and size can be estimated with relative ease.
This repository represents a work-in-progress set of tools that allow rendering 4D objects using axonometric projections.
